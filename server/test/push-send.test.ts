// LOCAL PATCH (apichat 2026-10-01): restored from upstream b35c3fd6^ for the iPhone PWA.
/*
 * Sending, and remembering who to send to.
 *
 * The encryption is checked against another implementation in
 * push-encrypt.test.ts. This is the rest of what has to be right before a
 * phone can buzz: the headers a push service demands, which of its answers
 * mean "forget this device", and a store that survives a restart.
 *
 * The push service here is a real HTTP server on localhost that records what
 * arrives. That proves everything except whether FCM accepts it — which is not
 * this repository's code, and is the one thing a container cannot answer.
