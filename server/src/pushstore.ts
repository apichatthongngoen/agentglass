 * was no longer the one on disk. A phone subscribing in that window is pinned
 * to a key this server will never sign with again — and the failure is exactly

 * service rotates it — so matching on endpoint is what stops one phone becoming
 * four entries and getting four buzzes for one gate.
 *
 * "Update what is known about it" was a claim this did not honour: a device
 * that re-subscribed was replaced rather than updated, so its history went with
 * it. Re-subscribing is not rare — turning the switch on when the browser
 * already holds a subscription posts the same endpoint again, which happens
 * whenever this machine has lost its file and the phone has not — and the row
 * afterwards read "Added just now · never alerted" for a phone that had been
 * receiving for weeks. A device list that resets itself is a device list nobody
 * can use to decide anything.
 *
 * So the keys are replaced, because those are what encryption needs and the
 * newest ones are the true ones; everything the machine learned about the
 * device is carried forward. A label only when a new one is offered — the
 * phone sends one on subscribe and not on every call.
