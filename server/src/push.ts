/**
 * Web Push: the envelope, and only the envelope.
 *
 * `deliver()` in alerts.ts reaches three places — an outgoing webhook, a
 * connected desktop client over the socket, and notify-send. None of them
 * reaches a phone with its screen off, and the phone's socket closes with the
 * screen *on purpose* (a socket reconnecting behind a dark screen is a worse
 * deal than a poll). So the one thing the companion exists for — you walked
 * away, and an agent is now blocked waiting on a person — is the one thing that
 * could not reach you.
 *
 * Web Push is the only mechanism that can, and it is end-to-end encrypted by
 * design: the push service relays a blob it cannot read. That means this file
 * has to get real cryptography exactly right, and "it ran and did not throw" is
 * not evidence of anything — a wrong key schedule produces a perfectly
 * well-formed body that the receiving browser silently discards.
 *
 * So it is verified against a vector produced by `http_ece`, which is the
 * library `web-push` uses and therefore the code that actually feeds FCM and
 * Mozilla's service for a large slice of the web. Byte-for-byte agreement with
 * an independent implementation is the strongest check available without a
 * device on the other end. See server/test/push-encrypt.test.ts.
 *
 * What is NOT here: subscription storage, the routes, the service worker, and
 * the call from `deliver()`. This is the part that is hard to get right and
 * possible to prove; the rest is plumbing and wants a machine where a real
 * phone can confirm it.
 *
 * RFC 8291 (message encryption) over RFC 8188 (aes128gcm content encoding),
 * with RFC 8292 (VAPID) for the authorization header.
